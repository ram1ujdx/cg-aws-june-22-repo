# Pratice Statement: Fencing a Barn

**   Ron wishes to renovate his barn. He thinks that creating fences and keeping the animals separately would help him feed the animals easily and prevent the problem of animals getting mixed. For this, he plans to divide the area into three parts. He wishes to have a square area for the chickens, a circular area for the ducks and a rectangular area for the cows.​**
**Write a program in Java to help Ron calculate the area for each fence separately.**
Note: 
- Input ‘side’ for the square, ‘length and breadth’ for rectangle and ‘radius’ for circle.   
- Modularize your code by writing separate functions to calculate the area of each of the fence shapes.

**Sample Input:**

    Select an option from list to calculate area of fence
    1. Square area for the chickens
    2. Circular area for ducks
    3. Rectangular area for cows

    1
    Enter side of square : 12

**Sample Output:**

    Area of square fence for chickens is 144.0

## Practice Statement: Aquarium Water pH Value

**The chemical formula of water is H2O (2 hydrogen atoms + 1 Oxygen atom). 
The term pH is a measure of the hydrogen-ion concentration in water.
The pH value ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 being the most acidic and 14 the most alkaline (basic). 
Neutral water has the pH value of 7.
For a goldfish to survive in an aquarium, the preferred pH value must range from 7 to 8.
The pH value of an aquarium may change from time to time.**

**Write a program that takes the pH value of the aquarium water as an input and displays one of the following results.**

    1.If the pH value is below 7, display “pH value is low, partial water change required”.
    2.If the value is in between 7 to 8, display “pH value is fine”.
    3.If the value is greater than 8, display “pH value is high, partial water change required”.



## Practice Statement - Palindrome 

**Palindrome is a word, sentence or a number that reads the same even after its order is reversed. Harrah is one such palindrome town in Oklahoma, United States. For administrative purposes, a list of all palindrome towns and cities is being prepared.**
**Write a Java program that states whether the name of a place is a palindrome or not. Print the words and display their total count.**

**Sample Input**

    String words []= {"Hannah", "Texas", "Renner", "Eleele" }

**Expected Output**

    Hannah is a palindrome
    Renner is a palindrome

    Total number of palindromes: 2

## Practice Statement: Bookstore

**The Hammond Bookstore sells books of different genres, such as fiction, religion, adventure, cooking, travel, autobiographies, etc., written by different authors.The bookstore has had a good sale this past year. Now, the end of the year sale is on, and the books from the fiction genre are being sold at a discount of 25%.**

**Tasks :**

1. Implement appropriate access specifiers.
2. Write accessor and mutator methods for all the classes.
3. Access the variables of the classes only through accessor and mutator methods.

```java
class Book {
    // Implement data hiding by declaring member variables private
    int isbnNo;
    String bookName;
    String author;
    String genre;
    float price;
}



public class Bookstore {
    // Implement data hiding by declaring member variables private
    String bookStoreName;
    String bookStoreId;
    Book[] books;

    public Bookstore(String bookStoreName, String bookStoreId, Book[] books) {
        this.bookStoreName = bookStoreName;
        this.bookStoreId = bookStoreId;
        this.books = books;
    }

    //Declare getter and setter methods


    // Function to calculate the discount for a genre of books
    public float calculateDiscount(Book book,float discountPercentage)
    {
        return -1;
    }
}


public class BookStoreImpl {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    
        // Declare and initialize author, book and bookstore objects

        // Use the get and set methods to set values to the variables

        //Display book details before discount is calculated

        //Calculate discount on the books by calling the methods

        //Display book details after discount is calculated
    }

}



```


## Assignment : Inheritance 
1. Implement an abstract superclass called Item and define all common operations on this class  (constructors, getters, setters, equals, toString, print, checkIn, checkOut, addItem, etc). Have  private data for: identification number, title, and number of copies.  
2. Implement an abstract subclass of Item named WrittenItem and define all common operations  on this class. Added private data for author.  
3. Implement 2 subclasses of WrittenItem: Book and JournalPaper.  
3.1. Class Book: no new private data. When needed, override/overload methods from the  superclass. 3.2. Class JournalPaper: added private data for year published. When needed,  override/overload methods from the superclass.  
4. Implement another abstract subclass of Item named MediaItem and define all common  operations on this class. Added private data for runtime (integer).  
5. Implement 2 subclasses of MediaItem: Video and CD.  
5.1. Class Video: added private data for director, genre and year released. When  needed, override/overload methods from the superclass. 
5.2. Class CD: added private data for artist and genre. When needed, override/overload  methods from the superclass.  
Write the definitions of these classes and a client program (your choice!) showing them in use.


## Practice Statement: Score of Students

**The total marks of all the students of grade 12, irrespective of the stream opted by them has to be calculated. The subjects vary depending on their choice of stream.**

**For example**

- A student who has opted for the medical stream will get marks for math, physics, chemistry and biology
- A student who has opted for the non medical stream will get marks for math, physics and chemistry 
- A student who has chosen the commerce stream will get marks for business studies, finance and accounts


**Write a program with overloaded methods that will help calculate marks of the different streams of Grade 12 students.**

-- Boilerplate --
```java
public class StudentMarks {

    /* adding 4 integer values.*/


    public int calculateMarks(int physics, int chemistry, int maths) {


        return -1;
    }

    /* adding 3 integer values.*/
    public int calculateMarks(int physics, int chemistry, int maths, int bio) {


        return -1;
    }

    /* adding 4 double values.*/
    public double calculateMarks(double physics, double chemistry, double maths, double bio) {


        return -1;
    }

    /* static method adding 5 float values.*/
    public static float calculateMarks(float maths, float bio, float physics, float chemistry, float lang) {


        return -1;
    }


    /* adding 4 float values with order changed.*/
